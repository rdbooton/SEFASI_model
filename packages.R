#from Knight paper
#Both acquisition rates (via transmission and de novo emergence) were dependent on 
#exposure to antibiotics, as antibiotic use clears sensitive bacterial carriage, 
#predisposing a host to colonisation with the (new) ARB. Linking transmission directly 
#to antibiotic exposure captures this impact of selection on both the source of 
#transmission (antibiotic exposure increases the ARB load) and the receiver
